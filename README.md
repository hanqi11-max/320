color sensor
Tricolor principle
various colors are mixed by three primary colors of different proportions (red, green and blue). Each color has a standard value. According to the above three primary color sensing principle, the value of a specific color is a linear combination of the standard values of red, green and blue colors!
For the TCS3200, when a color filter is selected, it only allows a specific primary color to pass through, preventing other primary colors from passing through. The TCS3200 sensor has four types of filters: red, green, blue and clearT. The filter mode can be selected by the high and low levels of its pins S2 and S3, as shown in the following figure.
